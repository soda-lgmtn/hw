# Autonomous Navigation Simulation System using PyBullet

This project implements an autonomous navigation system for a robot using the PyBullet physics engine. The system is tested in two different environments: a simple scene (Scenario A) and a complex scene (Scenario B). The robot is equipped with sensors to perform path planning, obstacle avoidance, and emergency braking.
